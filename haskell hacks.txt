1. Making a new haskell project
> stack new project-name-goes-here
> stack build
> stack run


2. Running a simple haskell file
> stack runghc file-name-goes-here


3. Haskell terminal thingy
> stack ghci     (to run)
> :q             (to quit)
> :l name        (to load a .hs file and use its functions)
> :t something   (to get the type of something)
